 # Working with Proof Of Existence Contract
 
 ### Notes 

 In this project I am working towards learning about the works of smart contracts of Ethereum. I wanted to use the Open Zepplin contracts to see how things work a bit more. This contract was created called Proof of Existence and has the steps within the link below to follow and understand. I am simply uploading to the repo to confirm that I went through such for personal reasoning. Hope it helps you on the blockchain developer journey.
